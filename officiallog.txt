    Removed libgit from git log command
    
    This removes the unnecessary git library from the git log command,
    which was one of the last major portions of the code to still need it.

Author: Dave MacFarlane <driusan@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 24 00:22:54 2017 -0400

    Began refactoring merge-base ancestory to not use libgit.
    
    This starts getting rid of unnecessary usage of libgit, but unfortunately
    comes with a fairly significant performance hit. The slice based implementation
    of Ancestors is significantly worse than the linked-list based representation
    that the old git library used.
    
    This will need further improvements to be useable before it can be merged into
    master.

    Treat remote branches are branches on command line.
    
    Added support for getting branches from refs/remotes and not just refs/heads,
    now that fetch will put things in the right place.
    
    This is the first step to implementing "git pull" (the next step is making merge
    work more reliably, especially with conflicts.)

    Various improvements on dealing with remotes
    
    This updates fetch to put remotes into refs/remotes/<remotename>/<branch>
    instead of refs/heads/<branch>, avoiding potential conflicts or fetch overwriting
    local work (and working more similarly to how the official git client works.)
    
    A panic in fetch has also been fixed when the local repo and remote repo had
    commits in common, caused by the flush line being placed in the wrong place in
    the request.
    
    Clone has also been updated to create .git/logs/HEAD after the initial fetch.

    Fixed bug where ls-tree would crash on large trees.
    
    The expandtree method was using the old libgit hack that
    used scanner under the hood. Scanner would crash if the tree
    was too large.
    
    This updates the code to use the TreeID GetAllObjects() method
    from dgit, which is more robust.

    Fixed bug where rev-list did not recurse into subtrees
    
    GetAllObjects on a tree was not obeying the "recurse" parameter, which
    resulted in an incomplete list of objects.
    
    This caused git push to fail if a file in a subdirectory had been modified,
    which should now be fixed.

    Updated UpdateRefLog to take Commitish interfaces instead of strings
    
    This allows different commit-like objects to be passed while being lazily
    evaluated, which should also make it easier for symbolic-ref to share the
    update reflog code with updateref.

    update the reflog, but is otherwise complete.

    The code which looks up loose objects was not correctly
    formatting strings which have leading zeros, this updates
    the code to use the proper format string for Sprintf.

    Optimized getting tree objects a little
    
    TreeID.GetAllObjects was still using the libgit hack, which was
    adding considerable overhead when trying to access objects in
    trees.
    
    This updates the code to directly parse the tree entry, and
    also adds a caching layer to the client to keep track of which
    packfiles have which objects in order to speed repeated access.

    Fixed bug where write-tree sometimes wrote the tree wrong.
    
    Indexes store all files in a flat namespaces of their absolute
    path, while trees recursively store other trees with paths
    relative to the parent.
    
    The code which tries to convert between the two had a bug
    where it would sometimes get confused by the last entry
    in a directory while parsing the index, resulting in it
    sometimes duplicating files into trees that they shouldn't
    be contained in.
    
    This hopefully fixes it, although the code still isn't
    very well written and I'm still not convinced is always
    correct.

    Index packfiles instead of unpacking them on clone.
    
    This updates fetch (and therefore clone) to use IndexAndCopyPack
    instead of unpacking all the objects it retrieves. Now that we
    can both index and look up objects in a packfile, there's no reason
    to unpack everything instead of just using the packfile directly.
    
    This should significantly speed up clones. An unscientific test
    of cloning https://github.com/driusan/dgit with "time" shows about
    a doubling of the speed:
    
    Old time: 1.47u 2.81s 32.58r
    New time: 0.00u 0.01s 17.42r
    
    Since dgit is a relatively small repo (with only ~1000 objects in the
    full history), the improvement should be more significant on larger
    repos.

    This allows other porcelain commands (such as fetch, and
    therefore clone) to use it without duplicating the code.

    Added support for packfiles in GetObject
    
    Now that index-pack is supported, we have everything we
    need to directly read objects from packfiles, instead
    of having to unpack them before accessing them.
    
    This restores interoperability with the official git
    client that was lost when I started ripping out the
    libgit library, but does it without depending on any
    third party libraries.

    Do not depend on third party library for checking if a repo has a commit.
    
    This now directly checks the packfiles, instead of relying on another
    library.

    Implemented git index-pack and refactored unpack-objects
    
    This adds support for git-index-pack, which is the first step
    towards directly reading packfiles, instead of needing to extract
    them loosely in order to use them. (Once done, that should
    significantly increase the speed of cloning, which currently
    needs to write one file per object.) This is also the first
    step towards getting rid of the third party git library, which
    is only currently used for dealing with objects in packfiles
    created by other git clients.
    
    The unpack-objects code was also refactored in order to share
    more code between REF_DELTA and OFS_DELTA, which was long
    over-due, but also necessary in order to also share the delta related
    code with git-index-pack.

Date:   Thu Feb 16 21:21:06 2017 -0500

    Only request refs/heads refspecs, not everything
    
    We were previously requesting every single refspec, including
    ones that aren't branches. This causes the packfile that's
    downloaded to be larger than it needs to be. We now only say
    that we want HEAD and refs/heads refspecs to make cloning
    (slightly) faster.
    
    Also advertise that we support the OFS_DELTA capability.
    go.googlesource.com was sending OFS_DELTAs whether we advertised
    the capability or not. Since we've done the work of implementing
    it so that we can go get golang.org/x/... repos, we might
    as well let anyone use it, and not just servers that are
    actively doing evil.

    Fixed bug with long OFS_DELTA chains.

    objects attempting to look up a previous object in the cache retrieving
    the data for the wrong hash.

    Handle multibyte OFS_DELTAs better.
    
    The algorithm for decoding multibyte OFS_DELTA offsets is different than
    the algorithm for decoding other variable length multibyte variables in
    a packfile.
    
    This adjusts the OFS_DELTA decoding to use the same variable as git.

    Added git unpack-objects command
    
    The work was mostly already done for fetch, but this
    adds the git subcommand as a stand-alone command with
    the same parameters as the official git client.
    
    This should make it easier to debug why some fetches
    go wrong, since we can save the packfile and go straight
    to the unpacking step.

    Added test cases for packfile deltas
    
    This adds some table driven test cases for git packfile
    REF_DELTAs based on small pack files created by the
    official git client, to ensure they get unpacked correctly.
    It also adds test cases for OFS_DELTAs  which are currently
    commented out because OFS_DELTA isn't implemented yet.)
    
    Each type of delta has two tests: one for the base case, and
    one for chains of length > 1.

    don't want to just call it "git", because then the binary name
    would conflict with the real git client.)

    Began adding read-tree fast-forward
    
    Theoretically, it matches the behaviour of the man page, but it's untested.
    (It also doesn't have support for -u yet.)

Date:   Thu Dec 22 17:44:54 2016 -0500

    Added git diff-tree and improved logic of git diff-index
    
    diff-index should now match the real git client, at least in
    the happy path case.

    Began adding git diff-index command
    
    Raw mode only, and the output doesn't match the spec yet,
    and it doesn't work properly in some situations, but it
    starts putting in the framework for git diff-* plumbing commands

    Made Add/Status work relative to CWD, no longer need to be in root.
    
    IndexPath is now a typed string that can be converted to File, so it's much
    easier to convert between file system paths and index paths.

Date:   Thu Dec 22 10:45:10 2016 -0500

    Refactored code into cmd and git packages
    
    Git is for types and implementations that take arguments and return
    in terms of Go object types, while cmd is for parsing command line options
    and wrapping around git library.
    
    This first commit mostly just involves moving the client to git/, the commands
    to cmd/, and then making any changes necessary to get it to compile. There's
    still a lot of refactoring to do in terms of moving the implementation details
    of the cmd/ implementations into git/, and updating them to properly use flag
    where appropriate.

    Fixed regression in clone caused by refactoring
    
    The Init() function was returning a new Client, but the repo that still
    gets passed around and hasn't been completely replaced yet wasn't updated
    to the Client's GitDir, causing it to crash downstream when the repo is used
    in delta calculations.
    
    This creates a new repo object immediately after Init in Clone in order to
    make sure it's pointing at the correct place. (The long term solution is to
    get rid of *libgit.Repository entirely.)
